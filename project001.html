   <p class="name">About me:</p> 
   <p> I'm from India, pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Applications at St. Aloysius College(Autonomous), Mangalore. I like to learn more and more about computers and its various streams that enable us to have a broader look into different things. Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </p>

   <p><span id="intro" class="name">AI(Artificial Intelligence) preface::</span><br> The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956 where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy. In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars.The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it". AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research. Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence. </p>

   <p> At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted. </p>
